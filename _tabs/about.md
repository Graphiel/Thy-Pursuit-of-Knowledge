# What's the point?

It is very difficult to find the reason from which this question had it's origins. Indeed, may i ask how did you end up here if not by some past knowledge of this page and it's purpose?
<br>
To give my fellow questioner a answer, however, comes in handy with the purpose of this page.

## Methodology

I made up my own, yet small, cozy and slightly lazy research on the benefits of spaced repetition on memory and it's potential applications within the routine of a self-learner.
<br>
Let be postulated that [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) are, indeed, the best softwares available for this purpose.

## The holy grail
The ultimate target of a (real)  _student_ is to **acquire** some knowledge, or atleast **learn** it.
<br>
Not by just a matter of speak, thyself must differentiate between **acquiring** something and **learning** something in order to _optimize_ your study quality.  More on that in the [_"Learning vs Acquiring Knowledge"_](/_posts/) section of this page.

As for to **Anki**, i recommend using a [custom card template](https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/intro.html). Myself enjoys this [one](https://github.com/pranavdeshai/anki-prettify/tree/main/themes/dracula), however you can find [plenty](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=template) online, [here](https://github.com/pranavdeshai/anki-prettify/tree/main) are some more templates from the same repository as the [one](https://github.com/pranavdeshai/anki-prettify/tree/main/themes/dracula) linked above.
